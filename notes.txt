+) rotation functionality out of the box
+) code can be extended but some (rendering) workflows are complex and take a long time to debug/understand

-/+) webgl renderer under way - experimental

-) scaling with text annotation (probably not to difficult to address)
-) off-image drawing/non rendering

-) preferred way of open layers to deal with shapes is to work with geojson and some predefined shapes
   most of it can be tweaked/wrapped but the stored svg paths are only easily wrapped if they use line segments/points
   canvas can deal with bezier for instance but ol does not cater for it specificially, it deals in polygons mainly
